Hi,

I've exhausted all options and I need to ask a question. I'm running Fedora, and I am actually trying to build a binary RPM with a test Hello World app (called "HelloPuppy"). I want it to show in the Gnome Software.

Now, I have managed to almost everything all by my little self. I can install and remove the app using "dnf install/remove", and when install it does indeed show in the Software Center (see screenshot).

BUT AND HOWEVER....

Clicking on "Open" or "Uninstall" in the apps' page in the Software Center does nothing. In other wolds, the page in the Software the Center does not seem to link properly to the application (although it shows the name, icon etc.). I cannot figure out what I am missing or doing wrong.

SEE SCREENSHOTS. Shows Software Center, and location of .desktop and metainfo.xml files.
