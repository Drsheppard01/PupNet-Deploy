Remove RPM desktop-file-validate or add to "BuildRequires"

RPM "AutoReqProv" - investigate?

Add "Requires" conf section for RPM and DEB:
https://github.com/kuiperzone/PupNet-Deploy/issues/10

Add multiple --kind values to arguments?

Drop to .NET6 for tool

Currently, ship runtime from:
https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime/releases/tag/continuous
as hinted at on AppImageKit page

However, think we should use runtimes from:
https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/releases/tag/13

Add parsable "changes" and integrate with RPM,deb and AppStream
