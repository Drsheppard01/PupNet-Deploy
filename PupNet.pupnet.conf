AppDescription = """
    PupNet Deploy is a cross-platform deployment utility which packages your .NET project as a ready-to-ship
    installation file in a single step.
    
    It has been possible to cross-compile console C# applications for sometime now. More recently, the cross-platform
    Avalonia replacement for WPF allows fully-featured GUI applications to target a range of platforms, including:
    Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android.
    
    Now, PupNet Deploy allows you to ship your dotnet application as:
    * AppImage for Linux
    * Setup File for Windows
    * Flatpak
    * Debian Binary Package
    * RPM Binary Package
    * Plain old Zip
    
    PupNet has good support for internationalization, desktop icons, publisher metadata and custom build operations.
    Although developed for .NET, it is also possible to use it to deploy C++ and other kinds of applications.
